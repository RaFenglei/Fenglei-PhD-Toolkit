# Fenglei's PhD Applications

This repository archives the comprehensive computational workflows and resources for my Ph.D. dissertation and related collaborative projects. It focuses on systematically deciphering the regulatory landscape of Periosteal Mesenchymal Cells (PMCs) during antler regeneration.

We employ an advanced multi-omics and AI-driven framework, integrating datasets and methods including:
- Bulk Omics: RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq
- Single-cell Omics: scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and Multi-modal integration
- Spatial Omics: Spatial Transcriptomics
- AI & Modeling: Application of Large Models (LLMs/Foundation Models) for regulatory syntax inference


This work has been conducted collaboratively by **Fenglei Zhang** (Master) since 2023 at the [School of Ecology and Environment](https://see.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of **Prof. [Wen Wang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/0147C7EFF01849A49FF04A590BCCBC58.html)**.
